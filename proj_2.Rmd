# Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

## Instructions

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

* Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

* Provide a basic summary of the data.

* Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

* State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.

## 1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 

```{r}
data("ToothGrowth")
data <- as.data.frame(ToothGrowth)
str(data)
```

## 2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

```{r}
head(data)
summary(data)
dose<-as.factor(data$dose)
table(data$supp, data$dose)
```

The ToothGrowth dataset explains the relation between the growth of teeth of guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1 and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods(orange juice and ascorbic acid).

## 3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.

```{r}
# T Test by supplemant type
t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)
# T test by dose level 
Tooth.dose0.5_1.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 1.0))
Tooth.dose0.5_2.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 2.0))
Tooth.dose1.0_2.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1.0, 2.0))
t.test(len ~ dose, data = Tooth.dose0.5_1.0)
t.test(len ~ dose, data = Tooth.dose0.5_2.0)
t.test(len ~ dose, data = Tooth.dose1.0_2.0)
# T test for supplement by dose level
Tooth.dose0.5 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 0.5)
Tooth.dose1.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 1.0)
Tooth.dose2.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 2.0)
t.test(len ~ supp, data = Tooth.dose0.5)
t.test(len ~ supp, data = Tooth.dose1.0)
t.test(len ~ supp, data = Tooth.dose2.0)
```

## 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions. 

The p.value indicators for doses of ```0.5``` and ```1.0``` are ```0.0064``` and ```0.001``` respectively, being less than 5% and the confidence intervals of the test do not contain 0.
The p.value for the dose of ```2.0``` is ```0.064```, which is greater than 5% and the confidence test contains 0.
Based of the results, we can say that for doses of ```0.5``` and ```1.0```, OJ has a greater effect on Tooth Growth than VC. For the test at ```dose == 2.0``` we cannot reject the Ho. 

We can then conclude that to get greater tooth growth with low levels of dosage (0.5 & 1.0) one should use OJ instead of VC. At greater levels (2.0) of dosage it is uncertain whether there will be a greater effect from either OJ or VC.
